The project is a child-centered educational and interactive game where the user gets to explore the various biological risks missions to space pose and the diverse organisms' biological capabilities that can withstand such hazards in space so as to build a better understanding of how spaceflight affects living systems in spacecraft. The main objective of the game is to spread awareness among the younger generation and to feed their curiosity about space through quizzes, community support, multi-player challenges, real-life depictions, characters, and more. In the end, the child gets to build a biological indestructible superhero that can survive long missions to Mars!
